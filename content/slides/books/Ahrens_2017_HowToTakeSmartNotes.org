#+TITLE: How to take smart notes
#+AUTHOR: Sönke Ahrens

* Who: The Inventor
Nicolas Luhmann
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 70%;">
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Major in law
- Interested in philosophy, organizational theory and sociology
- Professor of sociology in university
- 30 years: published 58 high-quality books and hundreds of articles, translations not included
- He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down
- He raised three children on his own after his wife died early
- He never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like
- Researchers concluded his productivity could only be explained by his unique working technique

* What: The Manual of Slip-box Method
#+REVEAL_HTML: <div style="font-size: 70%;">
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Two slip-boxes:
  - Bibliographical: references and brief notes
  - Main: ideas he collected and generated, mainly in response to what he read
- One note, one idea, one card
- Full sentences and with explicit references (write with great care)
- Link between notes: Rarely would a note stay in isolation
- Not copy, but a translation in his own words
- Organize notes not by topic, but give each note card a unique ID
- A topic is just another note with links in it (developed bottom up)
- Index referred to some entry points (notes with sorted collection of links)
  - Not necessary in electronic version in my opinion

* Everything You Need to Have
** Something to write with and something to write on
 - pen and paper, keyboard and computer, etc
 - Capture fleeting notes
 - it should not require any thoughts, attention or multiple steps to write it down
** A reference management system
 - To collect the references
 - To collect the notes you take during your reading (literature notes)
 - Zotero (free), Emacs ebib (free, steep learning curve)
** The slip-box
 - old-fashioned pen and paper version in a wooden box is fine
 - digital version (recommended)
   - helpful with adding links and formatting references
   - powerful searching ability
   - mobility
   - Roam Research (expensive), Obsidian (free), Emacs org-roam (free, steep learning curve)
** An editor
- Microsoft Word, Emacs, etc
- Modern slip-box software already included

* Demo With Some Key Takeaways
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Creating by searching: A really powerful way of reviewing notes
- Syntopic Reading: highest level of reading in the book <How to Read A Book>

* Why: The Importance of A Good Noting System
** The right mindset and the right external tool are equally important
- Even best driver cannot perform his driving technique if he is stuck on rails
** Brain friendly
- present you with ideas you have already forgotten
- Brain is not good at storing information exactly
- Don't need to waste mental energy to think about where to put notes, in what format
** Focused Attention
- the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done
- We can avoid distraction of unfinished tasks by writing them down
- The secret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our shortterm memory
** Instant feedback loops
- growth mindset: To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, not avoiding it
** Ideas, new structure, new insight will emerge in a surprising way
- Connections
- Normal folder structure is rigid
** Teaching is a powerful way of learning (Feynman Technique)
You are teaching your slip-box -- your second brain
** Slip-box is fun to work with
- No need of strong will power
** Writing a paper, an article or even a book becomes super easy
- a good paper
- a good draft
- a series of notes
- rearrangement of notes
- take smart notes when you read
** To summarize:
*We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains*
